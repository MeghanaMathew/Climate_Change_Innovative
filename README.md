# Climate_Change_Innovative
I want to explore visualisations about Global Warming that could  help unite people to fight Climate Change.
        The rise in global temperature is slow but steady because of which many people have a hard time understanding the urgency of the situation.
        This is seen in the left line graph which tracks the change in global temperature for past 100 years. The opposing view on the right is a
        radial chart which also tracks the change in temperature for the same period. I thought this visualisation effectively opposes the other as it traces the
        newer tempratures over the old ones. This helps the user to notice change right away. Finally, it also resonates with the message climate
        scientists have been trying to spread "Act before the situation spins out of control"
